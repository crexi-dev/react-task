## Setup
Clone this repo. Install using `npm install`, run using `npm start`


### Task
The goals of this task are to measure your understanding of components and working with an API

1. The user profiles page is currently loaded with dummy data. Use the public API at [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/)
to pull in random users and populate the profile page.

2. Create a new page, a profile detail. Make each profile list item clickable, sending the user to a profile details page with that user's data
